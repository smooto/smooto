### Hi! I'm Melissa. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer currently specializing in React and Node. I'm interested in making cool stuff. I'm also interested in making boring stuff, if it teaches me skills that I can use to build cool stuff later.

I used to work as a project manager and product owner. Sometimes I help [CIVIC Software](http://civicplatform.org/) keep their projects and workshops running smoothly.

In my spare time, I like to make goofy apps and static sites about things that I think are funny, like [wizard paintings](https://smooto.github.io/lab-02b-image-gallery/) and [new age lifestyle brands](https://smooto.github.io/products-page/).
