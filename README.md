### Hi! I'm Melissa. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer specializing in React, Node, and Liquid. I'm currently working with [Vooks](https://www.vooks.com/) to address a variety of front end needs, including email development, web content and branding, and accessbility improvements.

In my spare time, I like to make goofy apps and static sites about things that I think are funny, like [wizard paintings](https://smooto.github.io/lab-02b-image-gallery/) and [new age lifestyle brands](https://smooto.github.io/products-page/).
